### Welcome to the Paid Memberships Pro - Email Confirmation GitHub Repository
This Add on for Paid Memberships Pro adds a validation link to the membership confirmation email sent to members when signing up for selected levels on your site.

The membership will be active for the user, but access to members-only content will fail until their email address is validated (the pmpro_has_membership_access_filter will return false).

The site admin can also manually validate any user through the dashboard by clicking the “Validate User” button on the Memberships > Members List or Users admin page.
